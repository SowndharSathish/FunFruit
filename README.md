# FunFruit Project

## Overview
FunFruit is a personal project that I created to practice my skills in HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. The main goal was to familiarize myself with the Tailwind framework and its utility-first approach.

## Description
This project features a static webpage that showcases various fruits with a playful design. While I aimed to experiment with Tailwind's capabilities, many of the components are not fully functional or responsive. This project serves as a learning experience rather than a production-ready site.

## Key Features
- Basic layout using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Static content showcasing different fruits
- Experimentation with various Tailwind utility classes

## Limitations
- The site is not responsive and does not adjust well to different screen sizes.
- Some Tailwind classes and features may not work as intended.
- It lacks optimization for performance and accessibility.

## Conclusion
FunFruit is a stepping stone in my web development journey. Although it may not be fully polished, it provided valuable insights into working with Tailwind CSS and HTML5. I look forward to building more complex and responsive projects in the future!
